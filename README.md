### Data Science Pipeline:

#### 1. Acquire
- Connect to the SQL company database (login credentials required)
- Summarize initial data to determine how data needs to be prepared and cleaned 
- Define functions to:
    - Create a connection url to access the CodeUp's SQL database using personal credentials
    - Acquire Zillow data from MySQL and return as a dataframe
    - Create a .csv file of acquired data 
- All functions to acquire data are included in [acquire.py](link here)

#### 2. Prepare
- Review data and address any missing or erroneous values 
- Define functions to:
    - Clean Zillow data and return as a clean dataframe 
    - Visualize nulls 
    - Handle missing values 
    - Remove columns 
    - Create features 
    - Handle/remove outliers 
- All functions to prepare the data are included in [prepare.py](link here)

#### 3. Explore
- Address questions posed in planning and brainstorming and figure out drivers of log error
- Create visualizations of variables 
- Run statistical tests 
- Summarize key findings and takeaways
- Define functions to:
    - Split the data to explore on the training data set
    - Run univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations for how features interact with each other and the target, logerror
    - Use clustering to further determine features driving log error and engineer new features as discovered
- All functions to explore the data are included in [explore.py](link here)

#### 4. Model/Evaluate
- Goal: develop a model that performs better than the baseline
- Develop a baseline model and linear regression model without controlling for counties
- Iterate process for each of the three counties
- Evaluate if the individualized county models performed better than the all counties model
- Summarize performance, interpret, and document results
- Define functions to:
    - Evaluate model using standard techniques: plotting the residuals, computing the evaluation metrics (SSE, RMSE, and/or MSE), comparing to baseline, plotting y by y-hat
- All functions to evaluate models are included in [evaluate.py](link here)

#### 5. Deliver
- A final Jupyter Notebook [(notebook_name.ipynb)](link here) for presentation that includes discoveries we made and work we have done related to uncovering what the drivers of the error in the ZestimateÂ® are
